# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Poke-Mem
This project is part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) full stack web development course. I utilized the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch pokemon data inside of the useEffect hook.
Poke-Mem is a memory card game that lets you choose between pokemon generations 1-5. a set of pokemon are displayed and you must click on each pokemon once to advance to the next level.
